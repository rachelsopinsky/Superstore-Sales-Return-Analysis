# Superstore-Sales-Return-Analysis
**Description**:  
In this project, I worked as a consultant to analyze the superstore's sales and return data to help the company increase profitability and avoid bankruptcy. The analysis focused on identifying profit centers, loss-makers, and areas for improvement in sales, returns, and advertising strategy.

## Data Files

### [Google Sheets Document: Superstore Sales Analysis] (


## Key Objectives:
1. **Profit & Loss Analysis**: Identify the top profit centers and loss-makers, and recommend which products should be stopped based on their performance.
2. **Advertising Strategy**: Evaluate the effectiveness of advertising based on profit per unit sold across various states and months.
3. **Return Analysis**: Identify root causes for high return rates, including product, customer, geographic, and temporal factors.

## Skills/Tools Used:
- **SQL**: For querying and cleaning the sales and returns data.
- **Tableau**: For creating visualizations and interactive dashboards.
- **Google Sheets**: For additional analysis and data cleaning.

## **Part 1: Profits & Losses**

### Key Analysis:
- **Profit Centers & Loss-Makers**: Using sales and profit data, I identified the two biggest profit centers and the two largest loss-makers by analyzing product categories, regions, and shipping modes.
- **Product Recommendations**: Based on profitability and return rates, I recommended products that should be stopped, with visualizations justifying these recommendations.
- **Product Subcategory Focus**: I analyzed which subcategories the superstore should focus on and which ones they should discontinue. The analysis was based on profit, return rates, and sales performance.

**Key Visualizations**:  
- **Profit vs Loss Comparison by Product Category**  
- **Top Products to Discontinue Based on Return Rates**  
- **Product Subcategories to Focus On**

## **Part 2: Advertising**

### Key Analysis:
- **Best States & Months for Advertising**: I identified the three best combinations of states and months for advertising, based on the average profit per unit sold. I visualized how advertising would affect the superstore's profitability and discussed the return on advertising spend (ROAS).
- **Advertising Spend Recommendations**: Based on the ROAS, I recommended the superstore’s advertising budget for each state and month.

**Key Visualizations**:  
- **Average Profit by State and Month**  
- **Advertising Spend vs Profitability** (Return on Ad Spend)

## **Part 3: Returned Items**

### Key Analysis:
- **Returned Products**: I analyzed which products had the highest return rates and why, identifying patterns in product type, customer behavior, and geography.
- **Return Rate by Customer**: I looked at which customers had the highest return rates, filtering out customers with only one purchase to focus on those with frequent returns.
- **Geographic & Temporal Trends**: I identified whether return rates were higher in specific states, cities, or time periods (months, weeks).

**Key Visualizations**:  
- **Return Rate by Product Category**  
- **Return Rate by Customer**  
- **Return Rate by State**  
- **Return Rate Trends Over Time (Seasonality)**

## **Dashboard & Presentation**

The final deliverable was a **Tableau Dashboard** that included all the key visualizations mentioned above. The dashboard allows the superstore’s management to easily track:
- Sales and return trends.
- Profitable products and areas to discontinue.
- The impact of advertising campaigns.

## **Future Improvements**

- **Predictive Analytics**: Add predictive models to forecast return rates and sales performance.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on purchase behavior and return frequency to tailor marketing efforts.
- **Additional Data Sources**: Integrate additional data sources like customer reviews and website traffic to improve the analysis.
